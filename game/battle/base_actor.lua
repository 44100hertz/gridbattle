--[[

   Base Actor: a set of methods and properties inherited into every actor. These
   interact heavily with 'battle/battle', which can give a greater understanding of the
   internal functions. See 'src/actor_loader' for more.

   The "Override" section gives a set of defaults that should be set within each
   actor class in 'battle/actors/', but not modified in this file (unless you
   want to change defaults globally).

   The "Call These Methods" section gives a set of functionality attached to
   each actor. For other functionality, see 'battle/components/' for a list of
   components, and 'src/actor_loader' for documentation on the 'attach' method to
   use them.
