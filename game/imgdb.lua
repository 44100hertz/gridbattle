   Image database: for multiple frames inside of sprite sheets, and animations

   Normal fields are:
       rect: {x,y,w,h} rectangle use from image (default whole image)
             for sprite/tile sheets, this is the upper-left corner.
       origin: {x, y} center of image; how far to offset when drawing
       count: {columns, rows} how many frames in a sprite/tile sheet
       anim: Animation. These fields are needed:
           fps: <number> framerate of animation
           order: <list> Frame order. 1 is the first frame

   -- The sheet named 'base' will be used by default --
