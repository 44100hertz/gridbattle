* Features
** TODO elements
*** TODO research and duplicate BN-style element behavior
*** TODO element graphics, give everything an element
*** TODO draw elements on info panes when possible
** TODO deck editor
Select which chips out of your pool of chips to put into a given deck.
*** DONE show chip damage
*** DONE design deck editor UI
*** DONE draw UI
*** TODO program UI
*** TODO save and load
** TODO memory cleanup
This is best done by keeping all loaded assets in tables. State exit
functions will be added that nil these tables. Possibly: an asset
manager is passed said tables, and clears them out when states get
popped.
** TODO multiplayer
Get two players up that can fight each o ther.
** TODO ONLINE multiplier (hooooo boy)
** TODO debug stuff
*** TODO any chip selector
*** TODO RAM, CPU, video info

** TODO configuration and saves
In order for the folder editor to be finished, it's needed to
implement this. Good thing I already have a serialization class just
sitting around, though it might not hurt to make some kind of custom
format if it's small and doesn't cause any problems, or to use someone
else's that doesn't suck too much.

A prerequisite to calling this done might be a configuration
menu. Best thing currently would just be screen settings, but input
will matter.
** TODO FPS independance
*** TODO optional locking framerate to game speed (hard sync)
*** TODO FPS independant (timestamp-based) draw code
*** TODO threading?
I really don't trust lua to thread properly here, lol. Though, we'll
have to see what conflicts arise. I don't consider it a requirement,
this game uses up no CPU.
* Steps
** TODO scene things
*** DONE scene "exit" command to be run on pop
*** TODO automate scene transitions
Tell scene.lua that you want a fade, and it just does it without
having to manually push a transition.
** TODO reorganization considerations
*** TODO requirements
I'm getting a bit tired of using "require" all the time. There's a set
of keywords that I wouldn't have too much of a problem with reserving,
maybe it's time that, based on the type of class being used, these
requires are avoided entirely and the namespaces are just imposed by
other classes, or things sent back through data.
*** TODO src/ and res/
A powerful, more generic engine that's less coupled to the test code
is what's suggested by this separation, which isn't a bad thing but is
misleading because res/ and src/ and highly coupled. It could make
things better just to put say, all of battle/ into the root.

This isn't an engine, it's just a game that contains engine components
in order to run in the first place. If there's going to be res/ and
src/, then I need to make sure that res/ is totally interchangeable
with any other res/ folder. That is to say that res/ doesn't need to
reinvent any wheels, while src/ doesn't rely on the current specific
layout of res/. For example, res/game.lua could be a file that's made
that just tells src/ how to initialize, etc. It would be good to make
sure your distinctions are as meaningful as possible.
*** TODO separating scenes from not scenes
I noticed that at times it can be hard to tell what's just a helper
library and what's a scene that's going to essentially run the entire
game state. It could be very helpful to separate these at first glance.
** TODO draw better info on battle screen
** TODO make sheets a bit easier
I still have to specify the width and height when making quads for
non-actors. It would be great if this was a bit more automatic, maybe
making quads for actors would end up being so little work that I
wouldn't have to do it implicitly.

This would ideally be done just by feeding a sheet into
the sheet generator, or possibly by creating a sheet object that just
fetches quads as needed. It might not be bad just to unify drawing in
general for this stuff.
** TODO make keyboard input more responsive
mostly for directions, just make it so the most recently pressed
direction is what registers, as opposed to just having left/right
priority, etc.
** TODO allow certain collisions to only happen once
Have a collide_time variable, and just check if it equals 1?
** TODO variants and naming
What I might want to do is, simply call things by name e.g. testEnem1,
then detect and separate numerals. The current scheme is just a bit
awkward, though servicable.
** DONE automatic text align center and right
** DONE show name of top chip on queue
** DONE separate battle actors into category lists
New thinking: it's already obvious enough what is and isn't
stateful. If anything needs to happen, it's just to improve that
distinction. Limiting things to be stateful or not is just a waste of
time.

Ents: All actors are entities, so they're run as well.
Actors: assume that all actors (player, enemy) are stateful.
*** DONE Make enemies explicitly specified in each set
** DONE allow states to let the previous state partially update
*** DONE pass in input as part of the update, rather than including directly
*** DONE make things that use input handle it not being passed in
** DONE game over screen, reset the game
** DONE lazy depth calculation
I wanted to do this, I did a decent amount of the work...it's not
worth it, there's nothing to gain. This can be revived if I actually
bottleneck again.

Calculate depth on each draw call, then update that to be only when
things move. Maintain a drawn game state, essentially.
* TODO aesthetic
** TODO player
** TODO enemy
** TODO more cool/trippy bg's
** TODO sound effects
 - Unified sound playback method; limits number of channels intelligently
 - named sound sources, searchable, etc.
** DONE crisp XM playback (supposedly)
** TODO compose music
** TODO shaders, etc.
*** TODO get love2d shaders working
*** TODO Add shine on panels
*** TODO Masked pattern effects
*** TODO mess with indexed stuff
*** TODO posterize filter
*** TODO palette cycle
*** TODO pixel upscaling and/or LCD filter
* DONE sorted away progresso
** DONE make enemies use attacks (chips)
** DONE give player HP, death
** DONE enemy list
** DONE make enemies aware of player
** DONE battle status info
** DONE class variants
** DONE table value to draw previous state
** DONE do actually use metatables, not classes
** DONE subdivided draw depth list
** DONE make menus nice
Menus should be primarily graphical.
menu.lua should create a runnable menu state from a set of data.
submenus should work as separate states.
the menu data itself should be as minimal as possible.
*** DONE menu example file
*** DONE rewrite existing menus
*** DONE convert current fonts to grid mono
** DONE battle chips
*** DONE chip UI
*** DONE example folder
*** DONE interface battle chips with player
I chose concept B. queue.lua exists as helper functions, but because queue
is just an array data type, I didn't bother with anything else.

Concept A: Queue.lua file; When the chip UI is brought up, a Queue data
type is passed to it. When the player wants to do things with this
queue, there's helper functions attatched to the queue to make it
work.

Concept B: The player holds the queue, and queue.lua just takes in
that queue. No functions neccessarily attatched.
*** DONE bullet
*** DONE boots
*** DONE wheel crate
*** DONE poison
*** DONE allow chip to affect actor state
** DONE make chips do more stuff
*** DONE whlcrate damaging enemies
*** DONE poisdrop throw animation
*** DONE boots push whlcrate
** DONE unified actor animation and state model
** DONE asset management
Well, now I know. RAM usage or object counts would help, but I think
that lua now knows when to GC things, and I make sure that images are
only loaded once.

Not really sure what is meant by this, probably better just to null out
assets when battles end, etc.
** DONE custom mono fonts via ascii grid style + spritebatch
** DONE joypad
* DONE rewrite
** DONE no more "actor"
** DONE image asset management
** DONE nicer animation system
Have rows, speeds in FPS.
FPS speeds were never really needed, I guess.
** DONE damage management
** DONE drawing origins
** DONE all actors with states
** DONE non-object panels
** DONE no more signals
Signals are dumb because they're really messy
** DONE no more "data"
** DONE 240x160
* DONE initial game
** DONE auto-sorting draw list (z-buffer)
https://love2d.org/wiki/Skip_list:Drawing_Order
** DONE drawing class w/organization
** DONE custom fonts
** DONE 6x3 grid
** DONE movement
** DONE debug menus
** DONE battle objects (bullets, etc.)
