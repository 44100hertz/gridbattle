* Great Big Refactor
** Resource Management
*** Paths
So, the resources are all under one path, RES_PATH. This doesn't bode well for
resource packs.
*** Packs
Design resources to be done in multiple 'packs' with simple dependencies.
*** img/ folder
Please move everything out of img/ and into a folder with everything else.
This also means, refactor uses of the Image class.
** unlocalizing / classes
Make way less stuff local and way more stuff part of the parent. The goal is to
allow multiple instances of anything, implement RAII.
** bigass return { ... }
Turn these all into x = {}; x.y = z; return x. Every one of them.
* Demo
** DONE determine whether to focus on pvp or pve
Focus on PvE!
* Features
** TODO elements
*** DONE give everything an element, show element in editor and battle
*** DONE handle elements on collisions
*** DONE make panels affect elements
*** TODO test some elemental interactions
** TODO ONLINE multiplier (hooooo boy)
* Steps
** TODO consider using Actor or Entity base class
Instead of having a bunch of checks for actor properties that override
default behavior, just make all classes implement a base class. This
is actually a hella good idea.

Make a battle/proto/ folder with prototypes for various actor kinds,
which can use each other, of course.
** TODO keep image data in sheets with image
** TODO use submodules for wad(s)
This will enable me to use a private submodule for mainline game
development.
** TODO pvp features
*** TODO cust delay
When one player wants to cust, display a timer on the other players'
cust menu; give them 10 seconds to finish before the game autostarts.
** TODO make some wad features less intimidating
If it's possible to automatically implement anything, especially in
customize, go ahead and do it in src/. For example, try love2d
coordinate transforms instead of just adding an offset value.
** TODO debug stuff
*** TODO any chip selector
*** TODO RAM, CPU, video info
** TODO make keyboard input more responsive
mostly for directions, just make it so the most recently pressed
direction is what registers, as opposed to just having left/right
priority, etc.
** TODO allow certain collisions to only happen once
Have a collide_time variable, and just check if it equals 1?
** TODO sound effects
 - Unified sound playback method; limits number of channels intelligently
 - named sound sources, searchable, etc.
** TODO compose music
** TODO shaders, etc.
*** TODO get love2d shaders working
*** TODO Add shine on panels
*** TODO Masked pattern effects
*** TODO mess with indexed stuff
*** TODO posterize filter
*** TODO palette cycle
*** TODO pixel upscaling and/or LCD filter
* Nope'd
** DONE Image class that handles images, assets, and sheets
*** TODO move all images into unified locations
*** TODO identify all use of images and change them into image class calls
*** TODO attach sheets to images directly
** DONE make sheets a bit easier
This would require too much restructuring so I'm giving up on it.

I still have to specify the width and height when making quads for
non-actors. It would be great if this was a bit more automatic, maybe
making quads for actors would end up being so little work that I
wouldn't have to do it implicitly.

This would ideally be done just by feeding a sheet into
the sheet generator, or possibly by creating a sheet object that just
fetches quads as needed. It might not be bad just to unify drawing in
general for this stuff.
** DONE use Coord in more places
This would require too much restructuring so I'm giving up on it.

I've been told this is better. That remains to be seen, though I'm not
going to reject it.

** DONE FPS independance via threads (if stable)
NO threads here, thanks.
* Done
** DONE rewrite occupancy system
make it so that, when it needs to be known whether an object is in a
space, the game will solve it for that particular instance. Occupy and
free would simply be replaced with whether "tangible" is true.
** DONE memory cleanup
This is best done by keeping all loaded assets in tables. State exit
functions will be added that nil these tables. Possibly: an asset
manager is passed said tables, and clears them out when states get
popped.
** DONE multiplayer
Get two players that can fight each other.

This would possibly require more elegant coordinate flipping. Maybe
built into draw, maybe not. For now, just make a custom flippable
coord type in the place where it's needed, and I can toy with how to
implement it elsewhere.
** DONE more cool/trippy bg's
It's now possible to do this, so I'm going to go ahead and mark it
done. I can make more BG's when I actually start developing a game.
** DONE make a stub assets folder
This should have the absolute minimum required to make things not
crash. It will help me to decide what matters for src/, res/, or in
essence, what should be under user control without modifying the
source.
** DONE automate scene transitions
Tell scene.lua that you want a fade, and it just does it without
having to manually push a transition.
** DONE saving/loading chip folders
*** TODO file save/load menu
*** TODO save/load chip folders
** DONE configuration and saves
In order for the folder editor to be finished, it's needed to
implement this. Good thing I already have a serialization class just
sitting around, though it might not hurt to make some kind of custom
format if it's small and doesn't cause any problems, or to use someone
else's that doesn't suck too much.

A prerequisite to calling this done might be a configuration
menu. Best thing currently would just be screen settings, but input
will matter.
*** DONE config menu
*** DONE saving config
** DONE automatic path solving given a root folder
You shouldn't have to put all those paths into game.lua. It's a bunch
of extra work. Ideally instead of path globals, just use a resource
class.

Actually I don't think this is needed.
** DONE Manage cross-path access
There's quite a bit in src/ that still manages things in other folders
either without being able to change the path, or just shouldn't use
that path in general.
** DONE variants and naming
What I might want to do is, simply call things by name e.g. testEnem1,
then detect and separate numerals. The current scheme is just a bit
awkward, though servicable.
** DONE res/game.lua
A file that tells the game what files to run when starting, so that I
don't have to code anything pointing to res/ into src/.
** DONE Do chips belong in battle?
Maybe there should be a dedicated folder for all that, but it feels
wrong to have chips.lua in src/, and just as wrong to have a chips/
folder that implements things specific to battle/.

** DONE Interchangeable "wads"
Resources were put into the root for now because I felt like it. I did
learn a bit about my structure by upending it :P. Anyway, ideally
there should be a sort of res/ folder that can be swapped out to run
different games, essentially.
** DONE better resolution/aspect independance
Maybe not arbitrary, but supporting 4:3 and 16:9 versions of your res
could be good. This is mostly just testing if that works at all.

** DONE automatic text align center and right
** DONE show name of top chip on queue
** DONE separate battle actors into category lists
New thinking: it's already obvious enough what is and isn't
stateful. If anything needs to happen, it's just to improve that
distinction. Limiting things to be stateful or not is just a waste of
time.

Ents: All actors are entities, so they're run as well.
Actors: assume that all actors (player, enemy) are stateful.
*** DONE Make enemies explicitly specified in each set
** DONE allow states to let the previous state partially update
*** DONE pass in input as part of the update, rather than including directly
*** DONE make things that use input handle it not being passed in
** DONE game over screen, reset the game
** DONE lazy depth calculation
I wanted to do this, I did a decent amount of the work...it's not
worth it, there's nothing to gain. This can be revived if I actually
bottleneck again.

Calculate depth on each draw call, then update that to be only when
things move. Maintain a drawn game state, essentially.
** DONE crisp XM playback (supposedly)

** DONE deck editor
Select which chips out of your pool of chips to put into a given deck.
*** DONE show chip damage
*** DONE design deck editor UI
*** DONE draw UI
*** DONE program UI
** DONE make enemies use attacks (chips)
** DONE give player HP, death
** DONE enemy list
** DONE make enemies aware of player
** DONE battle status info
** DONE class variants
** DONE table value to draw previous state
** DONE do actually use metatables, not classes
** DONE subdivided draw depth list
** DONE make menus nice
Menus should be primarily graphical.
menu.lua should create a runnable menu state from a set of data.
submenus should work as separate states.
the menu data itself should be as minimal as possible.
*** DONE menu example file
*** DONE rewrite existing menus
*** DONE convert current fonts to grid mono
** DONE battle chips
*** DONE chip UI
*** DONE example folder
*** DONE interface battle chips with player
I chose concept B. queue.lua exists as helper functions, but because queue
is just an array data type, I didn't bother with anything else.

Concept A: Queue.lua file; When the chip UI is brought up, a Queue data
type is passed to it. When the player wants to do things with this
queue, there's helper functions attatched to the queue to make it
work.

Concept B: The player holds the queue, and queue.lua just takes in
that queue. No functions neccessarily attatched.
*** DONE bullet

*** DONE poison
*** DONE allow chip to affect actor state
** DONE make chips do more stuff
*** DONE whlcrate damaging enemies
*** DONE poisdrop throw animation
*** DONE boots push whlcrate
** DONE unified actor animation and state model
** DONE asset management
Well, now I know. RAM usage or object counts would help, but I think
that lua now knows when to GC things, and I make sure that images are
only loaded once.

Not really sure what is meant by this, probably better just to null out
assets when battles end, etc.
** DONE custom mono fonts via ascii grid style + spritebatch
