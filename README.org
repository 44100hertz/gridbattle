* What is this?
This is a re-implementation of gameplay from the Megaman Battle
Network series, using love2d.

You can run it by installing love2d and running it in this folder. The
second argument is a path to custom resources, default "res/".

* Project structure
 - src/ :: The game engine; the most generic part of all this.
 - battle/ :: Battles, the fun part.
 - world/ :: The overworld.
 - foldedit/ :: A folder editor.
 - res/ :: Default game data.
 - stub/ :: The minimum game data in order to run without a crash.

* Plans
See TODO (ideally raw, not github) for exact details. I'm about to
enter some real game development that will be done in private (sorry!)
using this software as a base.
