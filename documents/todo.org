* Refactoring
** TODO OOP-ification
*** DONE Replace oop.instance with oop.class everywhere
*** TODO The GAME global
There may not be a purpose to removing the GAME global, but it would allow
multiple game instances (though it is not the only way).
*** DONE use 'new' to spawn menus. Also entities?
Instead of using 'new', I just added a menu.start method.
*** DONE src/folder
*** DONE src/config
*** DONE src/input
*** DONE Dialog popup
** TODO Eliminate use of battle.state
Change location of queue to player actor. Must relocate all mutable state here.
May become more clear if scene system is replaced.
** TODO Replace scene stack system with simpler loop assignments
   Must also use this to fix bug in customization dialog box, where local pvp
   freezes. There's a problem where the 'pause' screen for battle just calls
   scene.pop twice to exit the scene, and that's really hacky but I see no
   better way.
** TODO Introduce coordinate type
** TODO Switch to 2d artstyle
*** DONE In Battle
*** TODO In Map
** DONE Fix fonts somehow
** DONE Make menus use 'name = x'
** DONE Cut down serializer
Make 'serialize' write to lua and use dofile for reading.
** DONE Make sides of battle use index 1 2 instead of 'left' / 'right'
** DONE Scaling back Resources
*** DONE Scale back resource folder concept, remerge res/ with rest of game
*** DONE Move images back into their local resource folders
I actually just added subdirectories to img/, and I kept many game resource
files in res/, but only if they don't fit into other directories.
* Features
** TODO .exe and .love build system for releases
This will be nice to have before I make my first demo. Maybe someone else has
already written scripts for this?
** TODO Navi Enemy
I have some boss designs on paper, I should probably get some feedback on them.
It's that or determine what navi AI or animation features I want to put into
place, and make a simple enemy that has all of those traits.
** TODO netplay
Where to begin? I may want to separate a server/client somehow. I should start
by sorting out which data needs to be shared between clients.
** TODO sound effects
I should determine sound architecture. Similar to image, or channel-based
approach? etc.
** TODO chip selector for debugging
I just want a list of all chips and be able to put them into queue easily.
** TODO handling music
I should recover my old music from lanparty-code, get some feedback on it in
discord or possibly other locations (upload to soundcloud is ideal), and
ultimately decide whether I want a composer for me, or what. hi lorna?
** TODO possible feature: pvp cust delay
When one player wants to cust, display a timer on the other players'
cust menu; give them 10 seconds to finish before the game autostarts.
** TODO Battle editor GUI
The idea here is that battles would be easier to edit with a UI, rather than in
the current primitive format. This is likely to save effort in the long run, and
create a sense of unity by having visual lists of enemies, maybe even previews.
** DONE Use Actor or Entity base class
Instead of having a bunch of checks for actor properties that override
default behavior, just make all classes implement a base class. This
is actually a hella good idea.

Make a battle/proto/ folder with prototypes for various actor kinds,
which can use each other, of course.
** DONE Initial Element dev
*** DONE give everything an element, show element in editor and battle
*** DONE handle elements on collisions
*** DONE make panels affect elements
