* Battle
** Make chip queues a subclass of actors
Currently chip queues are weirdly initialized as part of the base class, and
possibly elsewhere. Ideally I just want to stick all their methods in one place,
separate from the other code.
** Other possible subclasses for actors
*** Position/movement
*** HP/damage
*** Actor/animation system
*** AI
*** "Navi"
** Fix Wheel crate
Wheel crate poses an interesting problem for the panel/occupancy system. It was
intended to be able to be shot back and forth, but this is only possible if it
prevents other actors from moving to the panel it is on. Maybe I will delete
this one.
** Strip away elements system
I need to make things better in general, and the elements system is confusingly
implemented and sort of useless.
** Eliminate use of battle.state
Change location of queue to player actor. Must relocate all mutable state here.
May become more clear if scene system is replaced.
** Navi Enemy
I have some boss designs on paper, I should probably get some feedback on them.
It's that or determine what navi AI or animation features I want to put into
place, and make a simple enemy that has all of those traits.
** netplay
Where to begin? I may want to separate a server/client somehow. I should start
by sorting out which data needs to be shared between clients.
** chip selector for debugging
I just want a list of all chips and be able to put them into queue easily.
** possible feature: pvp cust delay
When one player wants to cust, display a timer on the other players'
cust menu; give them 10 seconds to finish before the game autostarts.
** Battle editor GUI
The idea here is that battles would be easier to edit with a UI, rather than in
the current primitive format. This is likely to save effort in the long run, and
create a sense of unity by having visual lists of enemies, maybe even previews.
* World map
** Display actor graphics
** Display dialog box w/script
** Move actors to position w/script
** Move actors along path w/script
** Pause screen
** Saving
I need a plan on how to implement the save system.
* Other Stuff
** handling music
I should recover my old music from lanparty-code, get some feedback on it in
discord or possibly other locations (upload to soundcloud is ideal), and
ultimately decide whether I want a composer for me, or what. hi lorna?
** sound effects
I should determine sound architecture. Similar to image, or channel-based
approach? etc.
** Replace scene stack system with simpler loop assignments
   Must also use this to fix bug in customization dialog box, where local pvp
   freezes. There's a problem where the 'pause' screen for battle just calls
   scene.pop twice to exit the scene, and that's really hacky but I see no
   better way.
** Exe builder
** Fix video dumping
I reorganized all the folders and video dumping might not work. I might also
make it nicer.
