A funny issue: I thought it was a good idea to implement local (same-screen) PVP
in a battle network clone. There's a problem here! When you can screen peek, how
are you supposed to choose your chips? Should players take turns choosing a
single chip? Should there be a timer, rewarding the player who can enter in all
their chips before the other person has time to react? Do you avoid looking at
the other person's half of the screen, out of politeness? Overall, this is an
awkward feature. I do think local multiplayer is a good thing, I'm a big fan of
it, but I think in order for this to work properly it has to be on two separate
screens or devices! Also, my two-player code was slightly hacked in and removing
it has lifted a small weight off my code base.
